Since popular mod managers require a large community of people using mods for a certain game for them to consider supporting that game on their platform, installing the mods manually is currently the only way of getting them for Smushi Come Home.

The mods use something called BepInEx to load the mods into the game, the guide to install BepInEx to the game can be found here https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html

You only need to do steps 1-3 but if you want to change some of the default configurations you can do so with step 4.

In each folder there is a readme with the description of the mod and a dll file (the mod) which you need to download and move into the plugin folder of BepInEx.
