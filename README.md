Since popular mod managers require a large community of people using mods for a certain game for them to consider supporting that game on their platform, installing the mods manually is currently the only way of getting them for Smushi Come Home. It is possible that in the future I might create a mod manager to make installing the mods easier.

The mods use BepInEx to load the mods into the game, the guide to install BepInEx to the game can be found here https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html

You only need to do steps 1-3 but if you want to change some of the default configurations you can do so with step 4.

In each folder there is a readme with the description of the mod and a dll file (the mod) or a folder with the mod and asset bundle if the mod changes models (mod readme will specify as well) which you need to download and move into the plugin folder of BepInEx.

Currently the only way to tell if I updated a mod is by checking back here, eventually I may add a way for the mods to check what the latest version on here is and suggest an update but that might not happen.
